\noindent
Business Process Modeling Notation, also known as BPMN, is a vital tool that provides a structured and understandable visualization of the company's workflow. Leveraging such techniques can positively impact the company's workflow execution and improvement. However, generating BPMN models requires domain-specified knowledge and is often time-consuming, yet adopting approaches that automatically identify and extracts process models can prominently minimize the time and effort of process modelling.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a discipline that emerged in recent years, which allows the developer to analyze the Text based on its grammatical structure and semantical content. With credit to NLP technology, researchers can now develop tools that analyze the business process descriptions and develop tools to perform automatic extraction of relevant BPMN information.

Based on the state-of-art BPMN model generation algorithms, this article rebuilds the program with a more recent technique using \textit{python} and an open-source library \textit{spacy} as well as improves the recognition accuracy.
