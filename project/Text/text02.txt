Customers upload their complaint via an online form.
The form contains the insurance number, the amount of damage, and a description of the damage.
If the amount of damage is less than 100 Euro, an automatic plausibility check is conducted and the complaint is approved.
The customer is informed via email and the money transfer is initiated.
If the damage amount is above 100 Euro, a clerk checks the complaint.
The customer is informed on the decision via email.
If the complaint is rejected, the customer is offered an optional meeting.
