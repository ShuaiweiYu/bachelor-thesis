The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released.
The Client Service Back Oﬃce as part of the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file.
Then, the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police.
The SCT physical file is stored by the Back Oﬃce awaiting a report to be sent by the Police.
When the report is received, the respective SCT file is retrieved.
Then, Back Oﬃce attaches the new SCT document, and stores the expanded SCT physical file.
After that, some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file (out of scope).
