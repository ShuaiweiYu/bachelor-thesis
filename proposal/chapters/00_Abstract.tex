\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent

Business process models visualize the abstract business process into an intuitive graphical representation. By adopting them in business logic, an organization can potentially increase its productivity. Yet, modeling business process models is a complicated work for people who receive little modeling training, and thus they tend to document the business process using text descriptions. There is an urgent need to develop a tool for organizations to translate text documents into business process models. 

In this paper, we tackle this problem by using the natural language processing (NLP) technology to extract information from text descriptions and automatically generate the BPMN models. We analyzed the prior works of many scientists and developed a tool with an easy-to-use web interface in an innovative way.
