Your second job is to refine the extracted activities because some are incomplete and thus not understandable to the reader. Consider the given example.
1. [finish the process instance in the former case] as activity_20 can be changed into [finish the process instance] as activity_20 because "in the former case" is actually not very relevant.
2. [inform the storehouse and the engineering department in the latter case] as activity_21 can be changed into [inform the storehouse and the engineering department] as activity_21. The reason is the same as in example 1
3. [reserve it] as activity_6 should be changed into [reserve the part] as activity_6. Whenever a pronoun is detected, you should find the word that the pronoun refers to in the context
4. [order it] as activity_8 should be changed into [order the part] as activity_8. The reason is the same as in example 3
5. [the meantime prepares everything for] as activity_11 should be changed into [prepares everything for the assembling] as activity_11 because "(in) the meantime" is not our interest here, and a single "for" followed by nothing is not desired, therefore you should find the related words that are followed by this "for"

Based on such knowledge, try to refine the activities in the following text.
