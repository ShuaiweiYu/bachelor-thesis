Your second job is to refine the extracted activities because some are incomplete and thus not understandable to the reader. You should also examine whether the anaphora resolution is correct. Namely, you should check whether the pronoun that occurred in the input text is correctly mapped to a valid actor. If there is a pronoun in the output, you should perform the anaphora resolution to find a proper actor for the pronoun.

In the first example, 
[takes her computer] as activity_4 should be changed into [takes her computer home unrepaired] as activity_4 because the "takes her computer" in the context is not a complete sentence. Therefore, the relevant information "home unrepaired" should be added to it

In the second example, 
[fetch wine] as activity_10 should be changed into [fetch wine from the cellar] as activity_10. With the extra information from the cellar, the activity becomes more accurate.
<sommelier has another order?> as gateway_1 has the wrong anaphora resolution because in the original text, "The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver." this "he" refers to "the waiter", not to "sommelier", thus this gateway should be changed into <the waiter has another order?> as gateway_1

Based on such knowledge, try to refine the activities in the following text.
