Your first job is to identify the activities that have nothing to do with the BPMN process. You should perform a semantic Analysis to determine whether a task in the Assignment Output corresponding to the information inside the Assignment Input is relevant to the whole business process in the entire context. Irrelevant information can be 
1. pure descriptive information: if a task purely describes a phenomenon that has nothing to do with the business process.
2. Metadata: if a task purely describes what an activity is composed of in the metadata level
3. Examples: if a task originated from an Example in the Input, whose aim is to let the human reader understand the process more efficiently but has nothing to do with the process. 

In the first example given previously, process irrelevant information are
1. which are executed, in an arbitrary order: Metadata 
thus [execute two activities] as activity_12 will be removed.

In the second example given previously, process irrelevant information are
1. The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel: Metadata
2. The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks: pure descriptive information
thus [the evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel] as activity_4 and [is responsible] as activity_15 will be removed.


Based on such information, your first task is to identify the irrelevant information in the Assignment Input and remove the corresponding irrelevant tasks in the Assignment Output. 

Your Output should look like: 
Input: XXXXX
Output: XXXXX

Identified irrelevant information:
1. XXX: Reason
2. XXX: Reason
...

removed tasks
1. [XXX] as XXX
2. [XXX] as XXX
