Your first job is to identify the activities that have nothing to do with the BPMN process. You should perform a semantic Analysis to determine whether a task in the Assignment Output corresponding to the information inside the Assignment Input is relevant to the whole business process in the entire context. Irrelevant information can be 
1. pure descriptive information: if a task purely describes a phenomenon that has nothing to do with the business process.
2. Metadata: if a task purely describes what an activity is composed of in the metadata level
3. Examples: if a task originated from an Example in the Input, whose aim is to let the human reader understand the process more easily but has nothing to do with the process. 

In the example given previously, process irrelevant information are
1. The ongoing repair consists of two activities: Metadata
2. which are executed, in an arbitrary order: Metadata
and these irrelevant information can be removed from the lanes. therefore, the 
[the ongoing repair consists of two activities] as activity_12
[execute two activities in an arbitrary order] as activity_13
can be removed from the Example Output. activity_12 and activity_13 should also be removed from the connections. 

Based on such information, you first the task is to identify the irrelevant information in the Assignment Input, and then remove the corresponding irrelevant tasks in the Assignment Output. 

Your Output should look like: 
Input: XXXXX
Output: XXXXX

identified irrelevant information:
1. XXX: Reason
2. XXX: Reason
...

removed tasks
1. [XXX] as XXX
2. [XXX] as XXX
