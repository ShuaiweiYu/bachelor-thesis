I'm trying to automatically generate BPMN models with the help of the NLP technique; suppose you are a BPMN domain expert, and your job is to assist me with improving the generated output from my program. The input is pure textual descriptions, and the output is formatted textual output. Some rules are predefined here: 

Here are some rules:
1. the start event is always displayed with (start), and end events are always displayed with (end).
2. tasks are indicated with a [],
3. Exclusive gateways are indicated with <>, where the conditions can be specified within the <>
4. The Parallel gateways are specified with <@parallel>.
5. Every gateway that begins a branch should be followed by the same gateway that ends the branch.
6. An unique ID will follow all these elements.
7. Based on the actor who carried out the corresponding elements, the elements will be added to corresponding lanes.
8. Each lane with the same name can only appear once. If there is only one lane, it can have no name.
9. After all events are registered in the lanes, they will be then connected using "->".
10. For conditional gateways, if there should be some conditional specifications, it can be annotated like gateway_4-"the part is available in house"->activity_6->gateway_4_end.
11. Tasks can only have one coming connection and one outgoing connection. Gateways can have several informing and outgoing connections. 

You can wait to learn the given rules.
