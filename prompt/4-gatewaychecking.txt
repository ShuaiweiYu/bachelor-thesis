The fourth assignment is to check the correctness of the gateways. In general, if there exists some indicator like meanwhile or in the meantime, we can consider this as a possible sign of a parallel gateway. After the previous assignments, only one branch may be left within a parallel gateway. If so, this gateway can be removed, and the activities inside that gateway can be added as regular activities. If you believe some activities are executed in parallel, you can also create a parallel gateway to include these activities. 

You should also check the conditional gateways. You should look into the meaning of the activities inside a conditional gateway. In the first example, "If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable, the process continues, otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired." she takes her computer home unrepaired implicitly indicates that the process ends. However, my program cannot detect such implications, so you will have to decide whether an activity implicitly suggests the process ends. If so, you should add an end activity after that. When constructing the conditional gateways, if there is only one branch, I will add a dummy branch to the gateway, but sometimes such a dummy branch will cause mistakes. Therefore, you should also check the correctness of the conditional gateways and the conditions attached to them. If the length of a condition exceeds 30 char, you can add a "\\n" to it to achieve a better visualization.
